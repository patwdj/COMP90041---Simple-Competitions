# COMP90041 - Final Project

**Final Project for COMP90041 Semester 1, 2021.
<br> Lecturer: Prof Udaya Parampalli & Dr Thuan Pham**

# Project Description
Simple Competitions helps companies (e.g., retailers) create competitions to boost their sales. For instance, during Easter Sale, a retailer can use your software to create a lucky draw game. In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single-purchase final balance, after discounts, reach a specific amount, say $50. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish.

Competition policy and application functionalities are made to match project requirements.
